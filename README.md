# TelecomChurnStudy
Customers in the telecom sector have a variety of service providers to choose from, and they can actively switch between operators. The telecommunications sector experiences a churn rate of 15 to 25 percent annually in this fiercely competitive market. Customer retention is now even more crucial than acquiring new customers because it costs 5â€“10 times more to do so than to keep an existing customer. The main objective of many established operators is to keep their most lucrative clients. Telecom companies need to identify which customers are most likely to churn in order to lower customer attrition. In this project, you will analyze customer-level data from a major telecom company, develop predictive models to find customers who are likely to leave, and identify the main identifiers of churn

Understanding and Defining Churn

In the telecom sector, there are two primary payment methods: postpaid (where customers pay a monthly or annual bill after using the services) and prepaid (where customers pay/recharge with a set amount in advance and then use the services). In the postpaid model, customers typically inform the current operator to terminate the services when they want to switch to another operator, so you can immediately tell that there has been churn in this situation. However, in the prepaid model, customers who want to switch to another network can just stop using the services without giving any prior notice, and it can be difficult to tell whether someone has actually churned or is merely not using them at the moment (for example, someone may be traveling abroad for a month or two with the intention of returning to using the services later). Therefore, predicting churn for prepaid customers is typically more important (and complex), and the term "churn" needs to be defined precisely. Additionally, prepaid plans are more popular in India and Southeast Asia than postpaid plans are in North America and Europe. The Indian and Southeast Asian markets are the foundation of this project.
